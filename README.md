# Fanomaly

A conceptual full-stack web platform built with PHP, HTML, and JavaScript with a local database.

## Features
- PHP backend with local database connection
- Front-end design using HTML and JavaScript
- Form handling and user interaction logic
- Experimental layout and prototype-level validation

## Status
Prototype / Work in Progress

This project was built as part of my self-learning journey to understand full-stack application flow, including both front-end behavior and back-end integration.
